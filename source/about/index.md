Hi everyone! I'm Benji, a Norcal Jigglypuff player and UC Berkeley student creating a program to play Super Smash Bros. Melee for the Nintendo GameCube. I started this development blog to keep everyone updated on my progress working on this project! You can learn more about me [here](http://www.benji.li).

Falcomaster is a supervised learning program that will mimic human playstyles. It will watch a human play Melee through gameplay videos, then it will learn to make choices mimicking the human player.

`Coming Soon!`
